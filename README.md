The motivation for this fork is to continue the development of a Dart language client model for the Matrix communication protocol Client-Server API.
Considering the deprecated status of this fork upstream and move from this MIT licensed small library to a much bigger library under AGPL,
I believe there is value in continuing the work to make a permissively licensed alternative.
I wanted to start this from scratch, but forking from the last archived copy of this project seemed a better choice.
